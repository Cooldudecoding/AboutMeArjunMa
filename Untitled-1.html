    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>This is my about me page.</p>
    The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Hello! My name is Arjun Mamidi and that quote is one that I will always remember. It motivates me to just keep on moving and to never give up. Something I would like to pursue as a career would be something related to law. I like history and social studies as well as speech and debate. I am on the debate team at my high school and I have prior debate experience in MSPDP at Fallon Middle school and enjoy public speaking. I am not completely sure if this is what I want to do in the future but this is a start.


   <p>I also have a keen interest in history and geography and am a part of the competitive history club. I love physical activity and I need it to clear my mind and focus whenever I get distracted. I am  currently on the football team and have done wrestling and swimming for the past two years and I am planning on continuing it throughout high school. These activities have helped me focus in school and have better time management than most of my peers. </p>
    
    
    
    
   <p>I am very collaborative and like working with many different types of people but I can also work independently as well. I am currently on the football team and from this I have learned that everybody needs to pull their weight and no one can take a day off if you are on a team. This has helped me become a better team player with a greater motivation to work hard and get things done. All in all, my experiences and extracurricular activities have shaped who I am today and will continue to shape me in the future. </p>
